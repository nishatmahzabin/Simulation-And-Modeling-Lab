Comparison & Explanation\n","\n","**Q1. How did the determinant change and why?**\n","\n","A: For a 2×2 matrix, determinant = ad − bc.\n","\n","    Det(A) = (8×11) − (10×12) = 88 − 120 = −32\n","    Det(B) = (8×12) − (10×12) = 96 − 120 = −24  \n","\n","The determinant increased from −32 to −24.\n","\n","It changed because the determinant depends directly on the values of the matrix elements.When I increased one element (bottom-right) by 1, it increased the product ad, which changed the final subtraction result. Even a small change in one element can significantly affect the determinant.\n","\n","**Q2. Did the rank change? Explain.**\n","\n","A: No, the rank did not change.\n","\n","Both matrices still have non-zero determinants. For a 2×2 matrix, if the determinant is not zero, the rank is 2 (full rank). Since both −32 and −24 are non-zero, both matrices remain full rank.\n","\n","So the rank stays 2.\n","\n","\n","**Q3. How did the eigenvalues respond to the value change?**\n","\n","A: The eigenvalues changed slightly.\n","\n","Eigenvalues depend on both the trace (sum of diagonal elements) and the determinant. Since we increased one diagonal element, the trace increased, and the determinant also changed. Because eigenvalues are calculated from these values, they adjusted accordingly.\n","\n","So the eigenvalues did not remain the same — they shifted due to the modification in the matrix.\n","\n","**Q4. Is B easier or harder to invert than A? Why?**\n","\n","A: Both matrices are invertible because their determinants are non-zero.\n","\n","But, B is slightly harder to invert than A.\n","\n","This is because B has a smaller absolute determinant (|−24|) compared to A (|−32|). A smaller determinant means the matrix is closer to singular (zero determinant), which makes the inverse less stable.\n","\n","So, A is slightly easier (more stable) to invert than B."],"metadata":{"id":"UCFcEvN9gnCI"}}]}
